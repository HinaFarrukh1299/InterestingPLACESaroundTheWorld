  "PlaceDescription": "Updated The most westerly point on mainland Australia is this UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was founded before Captain Cook discovered land at Botany Bay, with Dutch explorers touching down here in the 17th century. The area is diverse – there’s a beach made up entirely of tiny white shells, stromatolites on the shore of Hamelin Pool and the salt mine at Useless Loop, which produces the purest grade of salt in the world and is only accessible via four-by-four – or visible from the sky.Facts on Shark Bay An expedition led by Dirk Hartog happened upon the area in 1616, becoming the second group of Europeans known to have visited Australia.The area has a population of fewer than 1,000 people and a coastline of over 1,500 kilometresThe half-dozen small communities making up this population occupy less than 1% of the total area.The bay itself covers an area of 10,000 km², with an average depth of 10 metres. The coastline is over 1,500 km long.Also some text that relects that my update method in the placesDataControllerWorks :Shark Bay is a World Heritage site because it meets four World Heritage criteria relating to natural values.
